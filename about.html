          </h1>
          <p>
            The <span>NAM</span> story begins with its founder Sama Nautiyal who
            at the age of 25 years when most people begin to think of looking
            for a job , She started to build The NAMs, Hotels and Resorts which
            today form one of the biggest and most celebrated indigenous group
            of hotels in India.
          </p>
          <p>
            She quickly set the footprints of an empire whilst maintaining the
            traditional warmth and grace of Indian hospitality.
